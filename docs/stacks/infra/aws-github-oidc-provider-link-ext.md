# AWS GitHub OpenID Connect Provider Link (Extension)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) enables your GitHub Actions workflows to securely access AWS resources without the need to store long-lived AWS credentials as GitHub secrets. This approach ensures temporary, secure access while eliminating the risk of credential exposure.

To learn more about security hardening with OIDC visit the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) and [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html).

> **Important**: AWS only allows a single OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider of a specific type (in this case, GitHub) per account. The AWS GitHub OpenID Connect Provider Link (Extension) is designed for cases where a GitHub OIDC provider has already been manually set up â€” this is common when sharing an AWS account across multiple Techtuin tenants or using the AWS account with other Techtuin AWS infrastructure stacks. If you're setting up the provider for the first time, please use our [AWS GitHub OpenID Connect Provider (Extension)](./aws-github-oidc-provider-ext) instead..

## Reference

### Parameters
