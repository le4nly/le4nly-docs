# AWS Account Link

An AWS Account Link is like the smaller sibling of an [AWS Landing Zone](./aws-landing-zone). While an AWS Landing Zone provides a comprehensive, pre-configured, and scalable multi-account environment that follows best practices, the Techtuin Account Link offers a simpler but effective way to connect your existing AWS account to Techtuin. Although not as robust as a full Landing Zone, the AWS Account Link serves as a solid foundation for deploying and managing platforms and applications on AWS. Once deployed, it seamlessly integrates your AWS account with Techtuin, enabling streamlined operations and faster deployments.

## Reference

### Parameters

- **Deployment Name**: The deployment name uniquely identifies a stack within your Techtuin tenant. It should be descriptive yet easy to understand, allowing you to quickly recognize the purpose or function of the deployment at a glance.

- **AWS Primary Region**: Specifies the primary AWS region you intend to use. This region will serve as the default location for deploying workloads unless specified otherwise. Note that this selection is not exclusiveâ€”other AWS regions remain available and can be utilized for specific use cases, such as disaster recovery or multi-region deployments. Detailed information about regions can be found in the [official AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).

- **AWS Integration**: Selection of a **Techtuin AWS Integration** to link your AWS account with Techtuin. The permissions of the chosen integration will apply to all workloads and operations Techtuin manages within this account. For more details, refer to the [AWS Integration Guide](../../guides/integrations/aws). Ensure the selected integration has the necessary permissions for your intended use case.
