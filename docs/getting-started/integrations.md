# Enable your first integrations

Your Techtuin account is only as powerful as the integrations you enable. By connecting your account with external tools, services, or applications, you can:

- Bootstrap new application source code in your preferred Source Code Management solution (e.g. Github)

- Deploy a cloud landing zone with your cloud provider of choice (e.g. AWS)

- Self-serve CI/CD processes by the click of a button (e.g. GitLab Pipelines)

- Streamline observability instrumentation, from simple out-of-the-box monitoring solutions (e.g. AWS CloudWatch) to advanced observability suites (e.g. Dynatrace)

... and much more.
