# Enable your first integrations

Your Techtuin account is only as powerful as the integrations you enable. By connecting your account with external tools, services, or applications, you can:

- Bootstrap new application source code in your preferred Source Code Management solution (e.g. Github)

- Deploy a cloud landing zone with your cloud provider of choice (e.g. AWS)

- Self-serve CI/CD processes by the click of a button (e.g. GitLab Pipelines)

- Streamline observability instrumentation, from simple out-of-the-box monitoring solutions (e.g. AWS CloudWatch) to advanced observability suites (e.g. Dynatrace)

... and much more.

## Integrations

For a full list of available integrations head over to our [integration docs](../guides/integrations).

## Example Use Case

In this getting started guide, we’ll walk through deploying a simple static website. Before deploying the actual application, we need to set up two essential integrations:

1. **Infrastructure Provider**: This allows us to deploy the necessary infrastructure for your application.
2. **Git Provider**: This enables hosting and managing your application’s source code.

This guide will cover AWS and GitHub integrations, but you’re free to choose any supported providers that suit your needs. For example, you can opt for [Microsoft Azure](../guides/integrations/azure) or [Google Cloud](../guides/integrations/gcp) as your infrastructure provider, or use [GitLab](../guides/integrations/gitlab) or [Bitbucket](../guides/integrations/bitbucket) for source code management.

### AWS Integration

Please refer to our [AWS integration guide](../guides/integrations/aws) and return once your AWS integration is successfully set up and ready for use in your Techtuin tenant. (<a href="../guides/integrations/aws" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>)

### GitHub Integration

Please refer to our [GitHub integration guide](../guides/integrations/github) and return once your GitHub integration is successfully set up and ready for use in your Techtuin tenant. (<a href="../guides/integrations/github" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>)
